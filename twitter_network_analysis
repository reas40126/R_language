Network analysis is to understand the relationship and network among different users. 
This function is used for those who do the retweets and understand the retweet network.
Also, through the analysis, this can show the nformation flow between users who initiate brand messaging for a travel portal and users who promote such posts through their retweets

# Extract source vertex and target vertex from the tweet data frame
rtwt_df <- twts_trvl[, c("screen_name" , "retweet_screen_name" )]

# View the data frame
head(rtwt_df)

# Remove rows with missing values
rtwt_df_new <- rtwt_df[complete.cases(rtwt_df), ]

# Create a matrix
rtwt_matrx <- as.matrix(rtwt_df_new)
head(rtwt_matrx)

# Calculate out-degree scores from the retweet network
out_degree <- degree(nw_rtweet, mode = c("out"))

# Sort the out-degree scores in decreasing order
out_degree_sort <- sort(out_degree, decreasing = TRUE)

# View users with the top 10 out-degree scores
out_degree_sort[1:10]

# Compute the in-degree scores from the retweet network
in_degree <- degree(nw_rtweet, mode = c("in"))

# Sort the in-degree scores in decreasing order
in_degree_sort <- sort(in_degree, decreasing = TRUE)

# View users with the top 10 in-degree scores
in_degree_sort[1:10]

# Calculate the betweenness scores from the retweet network
betwn_nw <- betweenness(nw_rtweet, directed = TRUE)

# Sort betweenness scores in decreasing order and round the values
betwn_nw_sort <- betwn_nw %>%
                    sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
                    round()

# View users with the top 10 betweenness scores 
betwn_nw_sort[1:10]
